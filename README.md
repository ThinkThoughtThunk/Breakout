# Breakout

## (Old project from the dark ages)

This was one of my first "real"(?) projects I wrote when learning to code. It's a re-implementation of the classic Breakout game with some `canvas` rendering and Newtonian physics. It works pretty well for the most part, but looking back on it, the rendering was not implemented correctly.
